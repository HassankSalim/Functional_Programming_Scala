Hurdles i faced :sweat_smile:
---------
- Week 1
  - Last assignment question (coinChange) from week 1 [soln](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-7-coin-change/)

- Week 2
  - Evaluation of class in scala worksheet is different in Intellji and Eclipse [Soln For Intellji users](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33630274/intellij-worksheet-and-classes-defined-in-it)
  - Assignment hints : Consider Set as functions, for example union(s, t) returns a functions
  - If nothing works out check these links
    * [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19204631/union-of-two-sets-in-scala)
    * I prefer my exists functions over the one implemented here [Github](https://github.com/erlinis/scala-progfun-funsets/blob/master/src/main/scala/funsets/FunSets.scala)

- Week 3
  - User defined class should be compiled before importing this can be done by Click the play/run button
